<p><b>The Space Suit<br><br></b></p>
<p>
I am Character. Vagabond mathematician, travel writer. Perhaps you've read my work?
Likely not, for fame is not mine. But it will be --- ahem --- might be. That is to say,
I'm in a bit of a jam. Having recently become helpless prey. The victim of a creature
somewhat akin to your world's <a href="http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammophila_sabulosa">Ammophila sabulosa</a>. The
displeasure of our meeting resulted in my paralysis and subsequent storage in a subterranean pantry.
Thus this message is a plea to you, kind reader, wherever you may be.
</p>
<p>
I'm in a cave, in a flat dimension unlike your own. Beside me is a horrible larva which will soon awaken and devour me. In a desperate bid to escape I've hastily penned a piece of software. Said software is installed on your world's Web. Said software is a crude implementation of a trans-dimensional Application. Time did not permit the polish you may be accustomed too, and I apologize. The Application couples your Web with the root system of a remarkable tree. A tree which grows across dimensions. One of the roots has penetrated this pantry prison, and through it I hope to escape.
</p>
<p>
The Application contains my spare Space Suit, which will enable the wearer to enter a plane of your dimension. Please, bring this suit to me. I am in dire need of rescue.
</p>
<p class="buttons">
    <a class="button" href="application.html">launch application</a>
    <a class="button" href="1-2.pdf">print markers #1 & 2</a>
    <a class="button" href="3.pdf">print marker #3</a>
</p>
<p>
Important technical information: Aside the printed markers, this prototype requires a very modern browser. You'll need either <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/">Mozilla Firefox Aurora</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html">Google Chrome Canary</a>. If you are using Aurora, open <b>about:config</b> and set <b>media.navigator.enabled</b> to <i>true</i>. On startup the browser will ask for your authorization before the webcam is activated. Both Aurora and Canary are as unpredicable/unstable as advertised, so if you experience any problems then a page reload might be the only solution.
</p>
<p>
This prototype employs a number of wonderful Open Source projects. They are:
<ul>
    <li>JSAR Toolkit: <a href="https://github.com/kig/JSARToolKit">https://github.com/kig/JSARToolKit</a>, a javascript port of FLAR Toolkit, which is Flash port of <a href="www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/">ARToolkit</a></li>
    <li>THREE.JS: <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/</a></li>
    <li>RequireJS: <a href="http://requirejs.org/">http://requirejs.org/</a></li>
</ul>

Software licenses are confusing and confounding to this author. The source code to this application is available on Bitbucket.
